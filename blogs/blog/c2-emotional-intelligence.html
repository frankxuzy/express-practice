                      <ul>Q: What learnings did you take from the chapter?</ul>
                      <ul>A: It's really hard for me to finish the first chapter, I'm not a native english speaker. From this chapter, I found EQ is not only about interact with others, but also about internal optimization. And It's trainable. </ul>

                      <ul>Q: How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</ul>
                      <ul>A: I found myself being trapped by uncountable useless information everyday. It's a huge distraction and turn out that it more and more hard for me to focus on one thing for a long time. I tried to practice meditation but It's so hard to empty my mind. </ul>             
                      <ul>Two minutes of mindfulness seems a brilliant idea. It's easier to focus on your breath than empty your mind. The easier way is even batter. I will try to do this every day to see if any good things happen.</ul>
