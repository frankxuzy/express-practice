                      <ul>Q: What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</ul>
                      <ul>A: I think it's great to gather people with the same passion together and achieve the same goals. I totally agree the idea that you will go fast when you go alone, you will go far when you go together.  </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                      <ul>A: I'm so excited to find people with same passion and looking forward the coming bootcamp.</ul>

                      <ul>Q: How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</ul>
                      <ul>A: I totally agree the Three Pillars, from my understanding, it means follow your heart, try your best and help others to make progress together.</ul>                             
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <ul>Q: Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</ul>
                      <ul>A: This is the first week of phase 0, I think I may answer this questions by the end of the bootcamp.</ul>

                      <ul>Q: Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</ul>   
                      <ul>A: It's excited and I feel nervous a little bit. It reminds me of my first day of work. It's always great to meet new people with same passion. Looking forward to seeing you guys in coming bootcamp.</ul>
